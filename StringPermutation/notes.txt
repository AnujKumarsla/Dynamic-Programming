Probablity and Statistics : mean , meadian , Standard deviation , variance , Bayes theorm , sum rule , product rule etc
Permutations and Combinations , Inclusion - exclusion
Geometrical Algorithms
Number Theory
Primality test and Totient functions etc

Number Theory - Sieve, primality test, fibonacci etc
Linear Algebra - Basic Matrices, multiplication, etc
Basic Algebra - Solving linear equations, finding unknown, etc
Statistics - Mean, Median, Variance, expected value
Basic Arithmetic concepts like mixtures, progressions, ratios, rational numbers, hcf / lcm etc.
Probability - Bayes' theorem, Probability distribution, etc
Co-ordinate Geometry - 2D, 3D space, distance between points, line equation, etc
Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics - Arrangements, sorting, permutations
Principles like Pigeon Hole, Inclusion-Exclusion, Induction etc
That is just for starting. Once you are comfortable with competitive programming you can learn following advance topics :

Graph Theory - Path, Node, Colouring, Matching, Components, Flow, etc
Calculus - Variable Minimisation, Maximisation
Error Analysis and Estimation. This is important for only few tricky probs
Game Theory - Nim Game, Grundy Number, etc.
Fast Fourier Tranformation
Modular Arithmetic

========================
Number theory is one of the most important part of competitive programming. Let me tell you some very popular number theory topics:

Prime Number
Prime Factorization
Sieve of Eratosthenes
LCM and GCD
Euclidean Algorithm
Modular Arithmetic
Modular Multiplicative Inverse
Eular Phi Function
Inclusion Exclusion Principle
Catalan Numbers
Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem
Recurrence problem solving using Matrix Expo
Chinese remainder theorem
Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Miller- Rabin Primality Test
Lucas Theorem
Enumerative Combinatorics: nCr and nPr
Discrete logarithm
Primitive Root Modulo N
There are also a lot of topics available for number theory in fact same questions have been asked on quora before.
